		<h1>Welcome to Basic Web Development</h1>

		<p>I've started this site to provide a simple and effective learning resource for anyone wanting to get a job in web development.</p>
		
		<p>I currently work as a web developer, and over time I'll be adding bits and pieces to this to hopefully 
		create a huge site with a lot of value.</p>
		
		<p>Some of my goals with this site are:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Responsive design first, allowing developers to learn to code from their mobile device without the limitations of a full size screen.</li>		
			<li>Use every framework. I'll build a site in each framework I come across to compare the pros and cons.</li>		
			<li>Provide advice, rather than just references, with examples demonstrating the common issues and best practises.</li>		
			<li>Develop a framework for information sites like this one that can be used by other developers to build large sites.</li>
			<li>Maintain my SEO knowledge and build a large traffic funnel to experiment with affiliate marketing.</li>
		</ul>
